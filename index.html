        <p>Films generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home and merchandising. However theatrical box office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners ranked by calender year, a timeline showing transition of the highest-grossing movies of all time. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office perfomance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.</p>
